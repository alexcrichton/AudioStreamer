/**
 * This class is implemented on top of Apple's AudioQueue framework. This
 * framework is much too low-level for must use cases, so this class
 * encapsulates the functionality to provide a nicer interface. The interface
 * still requires some management, but it is far more sane than dealing with the
 * AudioQueue structures yourself.
 *
 * This class is essentially a pipeline of three components to get audio to the
 * speakers:
 *
 *              CFReadStream => AudioFileStream => AudioQueue
 *
 * ### CFReadStream
 *
 * The method of reading HTTP data is using the low-level CFReadStream class
 * because it allows configuration of proxies and scheduling/rescheduling on the
 * event loop. All data read from the HTTP stream is piped into the
 * AudioFileStream which then parses all of the data. This stage of the pipeline
 * also flags that events are happening to prevent a timeout. All network
 * activity occurs on the thread which started the audio stream.
 *
 * ### AudioFileStream
 *
 * This stage is implemented by Apple frameworks, and parses all audio data.  It
 * is composed of two callbacks which receive data. The first callback invoked
 * in series is one which is notified whenever a new property is known about the
 * audio stream being received. Once all properties have been read, the second
 * callback beings to be invoked, and this callback is responsible for dealing
 * with packets.
 *
 * The second callback is invoked whenever complete "audio packets" are
 * available to send to the audio queue. This stage is invoked on the call stack
 * of the stream which received the data (synchronously with receiving the
 * data).
 *
 * Packets received are buffered in a static set of buffers allocated by the
 * audio queue instance. When a buffer is full, it is committed to the audio
 * queue, and then the next buffer is moved on to. Multiple packets can possibly
 * fit in one buffer. When committing a buffer, if there are no more buffers
 * available, then the http read stream is unscheduled from the run loop and all
 * currently received data is stored aside for later processing.
 *
 * ### AudioQueue
 *
 * This final stage is also implemented by Apple, and receives all of the full
 * buffers of data from the AudioFileStream's parsed packets. The implementation
 * manages its own set of threads, but callbacks are invoked on the main thread.
 * The two callbacks that the audio stream is interested in are playback state
 * changing and audio buffers being freed.
 *
 * When a buffer is freed, then it is marked as so, and if the stream was
 * waiting for a buffer to be freed a message to empty the queue as much as
 * possible is sent to the main thread's run loop. Otherwise no extra action
 * need be performed.
 *
 * The main purpose of knowing when the playback state changes is to change the
 * state of the player accordingly.
 *
 * ## Errors
 *
 * There are a large number of places where error can happen, and the stream can
 * bail out at any time with an error. Each error has its own code and
 * corresponding string representation. Any error will halt the entire audio
 * stream and cease playback. Some errors might want to be handled by the
 * manager of the AudioStreamer class, but others normally indicate that the
 * remote stream just won't work.  Occasionally errors might reflect a lack of
 * local resources.
 *
 * Error information can be learned from the <error> property.
 *
 * ## Seeking
 *
 * To seek inside an audio stream, the bit rate must be known along with some
 * other metadata, but this is not known until after the stream has started.
 * For this reason the seek can fail if not enough data is known yet.
 *
 * If a seek succeeds, however, the actual method of doing so is as follows.
 * First, open a stream at position 0 and collect data about the stream, when
 * the seek is requested, cancel the stream and re-open the connection with the
 * proper byte offset. This second stream is then used to put data through the
 * pipelines.
 *
 * ## Example usage
 *
 * An audio stream is a one-shot thing. Once initialized, the source cannot be
 * changed and a single audio stream cannot be re-used. To do this, multiple
 * AudioStreamer objects need to be created/managed.
